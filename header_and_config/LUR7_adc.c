 * \ref LUR7_adc sets up and retreives analog input values through 10 bit ADC for
 * the LUR7 project.
 * 
 * All code is released under the GPLv3 license.
 *
 * When writing code for the LUR7 PCB this file should not be included directly,
 * instead you should include the \ref LUR7.h file to each source file.

 * \defgroup LUR7_adc A/D conversion
 * In this module functions pertaining to the initialization and usage of the 10
 * bit ADC are defined. Possible analog values for conversion are
 * - ADC_IN4
 *   + PB7
 * - ADC_IN6
 *   + PB6
 * - ADC_IN8
 *   + PB5
 * - ADC_IN9
 *   + PB2
 * - ADC_TEMP
 *   + internal temperature sensor
 * - ADC_SUPPLY_P
 *   + PD5, Capacitor bank
 * - ADC_SUPPLY_N
 *   + PD6, 12V main
 *
 * as defined in LUR7.h.
 *
 * To start using the ADC run adc_init(void) once. To get an analog read out run
 * adc_get(uint8_t) for each acquisition.
 *
 * Conversion does not use interrupts to return the result, meaning there is a
 * time delay from starting a conversion before returning the result.

 * This function requests a conversion of an analog voltage level, waits for the
 * conversion to complete and returns the 10 bit result.
 *
 * Due to not using interrupts for returning converted values, there is a slight
 * delay in (pos. 100Âµs?) the acquisition time. Therefore requeting analog values
 * should be done sparingly. However, merely waiting for the result in a loop does
 * not hinder other interrupts to happen, it just slows down the execution of the
 * main code.

 * \return 10 bit representation of the analog value
